Wanna scream
Wanna scream like a banshee
In the street
And the energy manic
Dangerous
We don't wanna be classy
Try to be good but we too damn nasty
Make a scene make a scene
Make em panic
Bunch a wolves
And we reppin sheep's fashion
Fingers up it's about to get trashy
Try to be good but we too damn nasty
Stop losing focus
You think we don't notice
That it's all just a game to you
Look at this damage
Goddamn you a savage
How much more do you wanna lose
We're playin dirty dirty
We're in control
What's the hurry hurry
Lookin like you seen a ghost
*Repeat
不快に満ちた下剋上劇
軽蔑の眼差し
怒りを超えて生まれる衝動
今狼煙をあげる
Wanna scream
*Repeat
Too damn nasty
We too damn nasty
